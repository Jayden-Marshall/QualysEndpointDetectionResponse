<h1>Qualys Endpoint Detection & Response 

<h2>Description</h2>

The Qualys Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Foundation course provided comprehensive insights into endpoint security solutions, malware types, and families, and the mechanisms through which malware spreads. I gained a deep understanding of terminologies relevant to EDR, as well as the technologies, tools, and frameworks utilized in developing endpoint security solutions to combat threats effectively. Moreover, the course equipped me with the ability to assess and compare typical EDR solutions with an ideal EDR solution. Through video presentations and knowledge checks, I enhanced my understanding of these crucial concepts, reinforcing my proficiency in endpoint security strategies.
